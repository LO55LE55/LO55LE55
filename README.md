### Hey there! Welcome to my profile. 👋

I'm a Computer Science student who's passionate about building things for the web and beyond. I believe the best results come from a blend of solid engineering and creative collaboration. My journey is all about turning great ideas into practical, full-stack applications, and I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and grow.

### I'm Currently Focusing On:

* **Artificial Intelligence:** Experimenting with building and training models, optimizing pipelines, and applying AI to solve practical problems.
* **Full-Stack Development:** Leveling up both front-end and back-end skills to build functional and polished applications.
* **Algorithms & Theory:** Exploring data structures, algorithms, and the core principles that power computer science.
